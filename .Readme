# Hands On - Querries
# Querrying the nodes
1. Return // All nodes // - Match (n) return n
2. Return All Nodes with specific label (PLAYER) - Match (n:PLAYER) return n
3. Return players with their name and height - Match (n:PLAYER) return n.name,n.height
4. Return Nodes (Players) with height greater than 2.1 or weight greater than 120 - Match (n:PLAYER) WHERE n.height >= 2.1 OR n.weight >= 120 return n
5. Return  Nodes(Players) with a BMI not larger than 25
MATCH (player:PLAYER) 
WHERE NOT (player.weight / (player.height * player.height)) > 25
RETURN player
6. Return (3) players with highest height - Using Order By
MATCH (player:PLAYER)
WHERE player.height >= 2
RETURN player
ORDER BY player.height DESC
LIMIT 3
